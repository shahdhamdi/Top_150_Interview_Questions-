## Problem: Jump Game

### Description:
You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

### Approach:
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm:
1. **Tracking the Maximum Reach**: As you traverse through the array, you need to track the farthest index you can reach from the current position.
2. **Early Termination**: If at any point, you find that the current index is greater than the maximum reachable index, return `false` because you cannot proceed further.
3. **Final Check**: If you can update the maximum reach to be at least the last index, return `true`.


### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
